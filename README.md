# Portfolio Theory Python
Mainly used to verify portfolio theory implementations in c++.

# Development
I recommend creating a venv for the project by running
`python -m venv .venv`
from the root directory then run
`source .venv/bin/activate`

Install the dependencies by running
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
